  4. Maintain open communication with all team members, clients, and management incase of any issues.
  5. Build a strong team with the necessary skills and experience that can meet the deadline.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
- How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project;
  1. Ensures profit is generated.
  2. Avoids breaking clients trust where they are asked to pay more.
  3. Allowing for better allocation of funds where they are most needed.
  4. Help to detect potential financial risks early for timely correction.
- Strategies;
  1. Accurate cost estimation.
  2. Monitoring project expenses closely to detect potential risks.
  3. Have a well detailed project plan to keep you within project expense range.
  4. Trunsparency in the project to avoid financial loopholes.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
- Agile method- This is an iterative approach that break the project down to small manageable units.
- Advantages of Agile;
  1. It allows for changes incase needed
  2. Delivers work early to the market providing enough time for feedback and changes.
  3. Quality work overall due to regular feedback and adjustment.
- Disadvantage of Agile;
  1. Difficult to predict deadlines and expenses.
  2. High risk of scope creep.
- Waterfall method- This is a linear stepwise process, where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
- Advantage of Waterfall;
  1. Based on a clear structure hence easy to track project progress.
  2. Low scope creep since requirements are defined and agreed upfront.
  3. Predictable deadlines and costs.
- Disadvantage of Waterfall;
  1. Inflexible to changes.
  2. Long delivery time.
  3. Requires extensive planning.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
- Waterfall is best for projects that are limited to change, well-defined requirements, and a clear plan from the beginnig to the end.
-  Examples;
  1. Construction of a building since it requares a stepwise plan from the foundation to the roofing.
  2. Goverment project such as KRA where changes are unexpected.
-  Agile is best applicable for projects where changes are expected, clients demand quick delivery of working and personalized features.
-  Examples;
  1. Developing a gamming app such as eFootball where fearures change based on gamers' demand.
  2. Developing a commercial platform where changes can be made based on customer demands.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
- Methods for ensuring quality assurance;
  1. Automated testing to detect issues early.
  2. Continuous code review.
  3. Establishing checkpoints to assess quality and progress of the project.
  4. Continuous improvement.
  5.  Well documentation for easy maintenance and tracking.
- Why is it important;
  1. To meet customer expectations.
  2. Enhanced reputation of delivering quality work to attract more clients.
  3. Reduce post release expenses in fixing issues.
  4. To ensure compliance with industrial regulations.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
- Project scope to set a clear project objective, expectations, and risk management.
- WBS is a hierarchical project breakdown into small manageable tasks.
- why is it useful;
  1. Easy allocation resources
  2. Improves accuracy of cost estimation.
  3. Improves risk management.
  4. Easy to track project progress.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
